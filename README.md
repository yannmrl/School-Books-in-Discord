# School-Books-in-Discord
 A Python Script that fetches school book pages and returns them to a python bot to interact with users on a discord server.

 Coded this one in highschool to avoid me and my friends having to carry all of school books in our bags (some teachers hated me for that lol, everybody was using their phone on discord to get pages of school books).
 
 The Python server is linked to a discord bot that asks for pages when a student types `!manuel <subject> <page>` (manuel is school book in french)
 
 I then found for almost every subject a link to the jpg images of each page of the books and coded a python script that headlessly open the link, takes a screenshot of the page and sends it to the discord bot.
